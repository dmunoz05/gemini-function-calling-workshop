# Level Up Your App with Gemini: A Hands-on Introduction to Function Calling and AI-Powered Data Extraction

![Gemini Function Calling Workshop](docs/screenshot.png)

Dive into the world of AI and learn how to enhance your app with Gemini's powerful capabilities. In this workshop, you'll work on a practical project, filling in code gaps to create an app that can extract data from both images and text.

You'll leverage Gemini's function calling and multimodal features to automatically process invoices and expense descriptions, storing the extracted information for further analysis. No prior AI experience required!

### App featutes
- Register transaction by picture
- Register transaction by text prompt
- Use function calling to receive the transaction data

## What you will learn?
- **Gemini Basics**: How to integrate your app with Gemini AI SDK.
- **Multimodal Input**: Learn how to process both images and text using Gemini.
- **Function Calling**: Utilize Gemini's function calling capabilities to integrate with external services.
- **Data Extraction**: Extract relevant information from images (e.g., invoices) and text descriptions using Gemini's AI models.
- **Practical Application**: Build a real-world application that leverages Gemini's power.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Node.js 20+
- [ ] npm 10+
- [ ] Git CLI
- [ ] Your prefered IDE (Recommended Visual Studio Code)
- [ ] Web camera (Optional)
- [ ] Vercel account to deploy (Optional)

## Getting Started

### Environment file
```properties
# .env
GEMINI_API_KEY=[YOUR GEMINI API KEY]
```

### Install dependencies and Run application
```bash
npm i

npm run dev
```

### Your are all set
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the code under `src/`. The page auto-updates as you edit any the file.

## Challenges
1. Get a Gemini `API KEY` from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
1. Create system prompt
1. Initilize Gemini
1. Declare functions
1. Send text or image content to the model
1. Process model response
1. Register transaction

## Homework
1. Refactor `extractData`to get `functionCall.name` and invoke the function passing the `functionCall.args`
1. Create a function and its declaration to allow the Gemini model obtaining the current date and time. See an example [here](https://github.com/carboleda/gemini-function-calling-examples/tree/main/1.intro)
1. Add persistent storage for transactions. [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) may be a nice option

```plain
Act as an accountant assistant, you will help me to record my money transactions.
I share the transactions with you either as a text description or an invoice picture.

### INSTRUCTIONS ###
- If I provide a text describing the transaction, it will follow the following pattern: 'DESCRIPTION by AMOUNT, ACCOUNT'.
- If the provided a text and it is not clear or is not a valid transaction, you must report the error.
- If the provided an image, but it is not clear or is not a valid invoice, you must report the error.
- In any case, you must use the available tools to record the transactions.
